        <h1>What is ISKCON?</h1>
        <hr>
        <div class="content-wrapper">
            <div class="text">
                <p>The International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), otherwise known as the Hare Krishna movement, includes five hundred major centers, temples, and rural communities, nearly one hundred affiliated vegetarian restaurants, thousands of <i>namahattas</i> or local meeting groups, a wide variety of community projects, and millions of congregational members worldwide. Although less than fifty years on the global stage, ISKCON has expanded widely since its founding by His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda in New York City in 1966.</p>

                <p>ISKCON belongs to the <i>Gaudiya-Vaishnava sampradāya</i>, a monotheistic tradition within the Vedic or Hindu culture. Philosophically, it is based on the Sanskrit texts <i>Bhagavad-gītā</i> and the <i>Bhagavat Purana</i>, or <i>Srimad Bhagavatam</i>. These are the historic texts of the devotional <i>bhakti yoga</i> tradition, which teaches that the ultimate goal for all living beings is to reawaken their love for God, or Lord Krishna, the “all-attractive one.”</p>

                <p>God is known across the world by many names, including Allah, Jehovah, Yahweh, Rama, etc. ISKCON devotees chant God’s names in the form of the <i>maha-mantra</i>, or the great prayer for deliverance: Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare / Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare.</p>

                <p>Many leading academics have highlighted ISKCON’s authenticity. Diana Eck, Professor of Comparative Religion and Indian Studies at Harvard University, describes the movement as <i>“a tradition that commands a respected place in the religious life of humankind.”</i> In the 1980s Dr. A. L. Basham, one of the world’s authorities on Indian history and culture, wrote of ISKCON that, <i>“It arose out of next to nothing in less than twenty years and has become known all over the West. This, I feel, is a sign of the times and an important fact in the history of the Western world.”</i></p>
